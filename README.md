### Tech Stack - Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy

**Overview:**

Designed a basic Flask Quiz App where the user is able to register his/her account. Login into their account and choose 
a test type from the dashboard. Once the test is completed, they can view their results in the results tab.


**Future Work:**

1. Improve the UI
2. Create session management
3. Email validation and verification
4. Jumble the order in which questions are displayed
5. Add user column to TestResults so only the current user results are fetched
6. Frame actual questions and add them from file instead of writing in main function
